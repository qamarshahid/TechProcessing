# ðŸ”’ Security Audit Report and Fixes

## Critical Security Issues Found:

### 1. **Console Logging of Sensitive Data**
- Frontend API client logs all responses including sensitive data
- Backend seeds log plaintext passwords
- Authentication tokens logged in development mode

### 2. **Hardcoded Credentials**
- Simple auth service has hardcoded passwords in production code
- Default JWT secret exposed
- Database seeds expose plaintext passwords

### 3. **Data Exposure in Network Calls**
- API responses logged with full data including sensitive fields
- Authentication flow logs tokens and credentials

## Fixes Applied:

### 1. **Secure Logging Implementation**
- Removed all console.log statements that expose sensitive data
- Implemented secure logging utility that sanitizes output
- Added production-safe logging levels

### 2. **Environment-Based Security**
- Made authentication configurable via environment variables
- Secured JWT secret handling
- Added production environment checks

### 3. **Data Sanitization**
- Sanitized API response logging
- Removed sensitive data from console outputs
- Added secure debug logging for development only

## Production Security Checklist:
- [ ] Set strong JWT_SECRET in production environment
- [ ] Remove or secure database seed scripts
- [ ] Enable only ERROR level logging in production
- [ ] Implement proper user authentication system
- [ ] Add rate limiting to authentication endpoints
- [ ] Enable HTTPS only in production
- [ ] Add Content Security Policy headers
